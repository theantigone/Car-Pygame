# Racing Car Pygame

This project is a personal Python game developed using the Pygame library. "Try Not To Crash!" is a survival game where the player controls a car to avoid falling obstacles. It can be moved left or right across the screen to dodge the obstacles, represented as blocks falling from the top.

The game features a variety of elements including a main menu, a pause menu, and different game modes. The game modes include "Faster Blocks" and "Wider Blocks", which progressively increase the speed and width of the falling blocks respectively, adding to the game's challenge.  

The game also includes sound effects and background music, managed using Pygame's mixer module. Its graphics are handled using Pygame's drawing functions and image-loading capabilities.  

The game's code is organized and modular, with separate functions for handling different aspects of the game such as drawing the game objects, handling user input, and managing the game state. The code also demonstrates Pygame's event-handling system in response to user actions such as keyboard inputs and mouse clicks.
