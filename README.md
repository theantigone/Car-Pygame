# Racing Car Pygame

This personal project is a Python game developed using the Pygame library. "Try Not To Crash!" is a survival game where the player driving a car avoids falling obstacles. The player can drive the vehicle left or right across the screen to dodge the obstacles falling from the sky.

The game features a variety of elements including a main menu, a pause menu, and different game modes. The game modes add to the game's challenge by progressively making the falling blocks harder to dodge.

The game also includes sound effects and background music, managed using Pygame's mixer module. Its graphics are handled using Pygame's drawing functions and image-loading capabilities.  

The game's code is organized and modular, with separate functions for handling different aspects of the game such as drawing the game objects, handling user input, and managing the game state. The code also demonstrates Pygame's event-handling system in response to user actions such as keyboard inputs and mouse clicks.
